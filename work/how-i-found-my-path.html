      <section>
        <p> Growing up, I was never the kid who loved school or reading books. To be honest, I often found it boring and struggled to stay motivated. As I moved into young adulthood, I spent several years working at a fast food chain. It was steady work, but I knew I wanted something different &mdash; something that could challenge me and offer a real career path. </p>

        <p> That desire led me to join the Army. I hoped the discipline and structure would give me direction, but after some time, I realized it just wasn't the right fit for me. Looking back, that experience taught me a lot about myself, but it also made me determined to find a career I could be passionate about. </p>

        <p> Back in high school, I had an interest in computers, but I wasn't much of a good student. I took some computer classes like A+ and networking, and even tried the A+ certification exam &mdash; but I didn't pass. Despite the setback, I still had a spark for IT. </p>

        <p> After leaving the Army, I enrolled in a vocational school to study Information Technology. Unfortunately, I made some poor choices during that time, and before I knew it, I found myself back working in the fast food industry. It felt like I was stuck in a loop &mdash; but I wasn't ready to give up. </p>
        <p> Eventually, I moved to a new place where I could get some support and focus on building a better future. That's when I discovered web development. I had actually heard about it before &mdash; one of my coworkers in the Army was also learning it too. At the time, I didn't pursue it because I thought you had to be a genius like engineers or doctors to succeed. Curious, I started researching what it would take to become a web developer. </p>

        <p> I quickly learned that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the foundation of both frontend and backend web development. Excited, I dove in and began learning those languages. But I ran into challenges, especially with JavaScript. Sometimes it felt like I wasn't learning fast enough or understanding everything I should. </p>

        <p> To switch things up, I decided to explore backend development by learning Python &mdash; mostly as a hobby, not with a specific career goal in mind. Python was easier for me to grasp, except for concepts like Object-Oriented Programming, which still confuse me. When I looked at the full roadmap to become a backend developer, I felt overwhelmed by the amount of material I needed to cover. </p>

        <p> Despite the hurdles, I stuck with it, but the constant bugs and errors were mentally draining. I often had to take breaks to clear my head and come back refreshed. </p>

        <p> After all this, I realized my true interest lay in frontend development &mdash; creating the parts of websites and apps that users interact with directly. It combines creativity and logic, and that's exactly what I want to do. My journey hasn't been straightforward or easy, but I'm proud of how far I've come and excited for what's next. </p>
